* EAF

The command 'npm-install' overwrites always some of the
'package-lock.json' files in the 'app' directory tree since those
files are a mix of lockfile versions 1 and 2.  Therefore, it modifies
the git EAF repository.  The following commands ensure correct
installation of the JavaScript modules and a hard reset of the git
repository:
#+begin_export shell
cd lib/eaf
rm -rf app/*/node_modules/*
npm install
git reset --hard HEAD
#+end_export
